# 🐳 Jenkins-Powered CI/CD: Local Docker Registry + Full EC2 Pipeline!

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a fully automated **CI/CD pipeline** powered by Jenkins, running entirely on AWS EC2 instances. It showcases how Docker images can be built, pushed to a local private registry, and then deployed on a production server — all triggered by Jenkins!

---

## ✅ Key Highlights

- **Jenkins Master-Agent Setup**  
  Efficiently distributed Jenkins architecture for build and deploy stages.

- **Docker Image Built & Pushed**  
  Jenkins builds the application Docker image and pushes it to a **private local Docker registry**.

- **Automated Deployment to Production EC2**  
  A production EC2 instance pulls the latest image from the local registry and launches the **containerized web application** automatically.
